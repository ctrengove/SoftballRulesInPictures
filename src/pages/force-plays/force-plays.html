      <li>Tagging a base ahead of a Runner only when he is forced to advance, because the Batter became a Batter-Runner, makes a Force Out.</li>

      <li>This situation is not a Force Play. First base is open for the Batter, so the Runner at second base does not have to run.. A runner who is not forced to run must be tagged, while off a base by a fielder for the Runner to be out.</li>

      </div>
      <li>The Batter is out when a Fielder intentionally drops a catch with less than two out in order to make a Force Play possible. Rule 8 Section 2l. This rule prevents an unfair double play. An intentionally dropped ball is defined as a ball that is controlled by a hand or glove before being allowed to drop to the ground..</li>
