    <h2>A Team Training Session</h2>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Coaching Points:</p>
    <p>Coaches may find the suggested schedule for a team training session of assistance. It is most important to vary the activities in each session to avoid lack of interest and to stimulate the players to a maximum effort.</p>

      <li>Skill Practice: Batting, base-running, sliding</li>
      <li>Split Team Practice: Out Fielders skills, In Fielders skills</li>

    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Coaching Points:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Establish a worthwhile routine –
        <ol class="inner-list">
          <li>As players arrive a short jog is suggested (about 500 metres); increase this distance as the season progresses</li>
          <li>Pair off for warm up throws: In Fielders together, Out Fielders together</li>
          <li>Insist on quick changes from one section of practice to the next</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Aim at ultimate perfection of skills in all players</li>
      <li>Don't overlook correction of faulty techniques</li>
      <li>Develop good team understanding</li>
      <li>Team Talks –
        <ol class="inner-list">
          <li>Encourage all players to take part, but players must adhere to team policy</li>
          <li>Make full use of blackboard or magnetic board<br />These boards should have a permanent diamond marked on them.</li>
          <li>Discuss any team faults from the previous game</li>
          <li>Decide on plan for the coming game – Opponents weaknesses, tactics they employ, and strengths will all have a bearing. Signals to be used and batting order are also decided</li>
