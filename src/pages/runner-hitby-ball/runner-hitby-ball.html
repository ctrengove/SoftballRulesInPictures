      <li>If a fair batted ball hits a Runner who is in contact with a base, the ball is alive and Runners may advance. If a fair batted ball hits a Runner who is not in contact with a base, then one of three things can happen:</li>
      <li>If the Runner was struck and any fielder had a chance to make an out, then the ball is dead and the Runner struck by the ball is out; or</li>
      <li>If the Runner was struck after passing a fielder, other than the pitcher, and no fielder had a chance to make an out, then the ball is alive and Runners may advance.</li>
      <li>If the runner is hit by a batted ball touched by a fielder including the pitcher, the ball remains alive and the runner is not out.</li>

      </div>
      <li>A Foul Tip is a batted ball that goes directly from the bat, not higher than the batter's head, to the catcher's hands and is caught by the catcher. Runners may advance on a Foul Tip as the ball remains alive. If the ball goes higher than the Batters head and is caught by the catcher, the Batter is out. A Foul tip that is not caught is simply a Foul Ball.</li>

      <li>A Batter should run when he hits a Fair ball. He is then considered a Batter-Runner.</li>
