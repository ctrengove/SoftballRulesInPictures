    <p style="padding: 0 20px;">The Double Base sometimes referred as the safety base is approved for use at first base. Half the base is secured in Fair Territory, and half the base (of a different solid contrasting colour) is secured in Foul Territory.</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">The following rules apply to the double base:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A Batted Ball hitting the Fair portion is declared Fair, and a Batted Ball hitting the Foul portion only, is declared Foul</li>
      <li>If a play is made at first base on any Batted Ball, or (Fastpitch (FP) ONLY) the Batter runs on a dropped third Strike, and the Batter-Runner (Batter-Runner) touches only the Fair portion, and if the defence appeals prior to the Batter-Runner returning to first base, the Batter-Runner is out</li>
      <li>A defensive player must use only the Fair portion of the base at all times
EXCEPTION to Sec 4h 1c. On any live ball play made from first base Foul Territory, the Batter-Runner and the defensive player may use either portion of the base for safety reasons</li>
      <li>After over-running the base, the Batter-Runner must return to the Fair portion of the base</li>
      <li>On balls hit to the outfield when there is no play being made at the double base, the Batter-Runner may touch either portion of the base</li>
      <li>Once a Runner returns to the Fair portion he must stay on the Fair portion only</li>
    </ol>
