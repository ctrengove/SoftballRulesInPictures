    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A note on base awards: </span>Base awards are determined by the last base previously occupied by a runner. For example, imagine a batter hits a ground ball to centre field and, as he rounds 1st base to go to 2nd, they realise they won’t make it, so they turn around to run back to 1st base. The centre fielder then throws the ball over the first base fielder’s head into dead ball territory. Even though the batter runner was heading back to first base, they are awarded 3rd base because the last base occupied, or touched, by the runner at the time of the throw was 1st base.</p>
