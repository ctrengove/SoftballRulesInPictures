    <h2>Interference Plays</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>On all Interference plays somebody must be out and the ball is dead. If the Batter-Runner interferes, Runners return to the last base touched at the time of the pitch. If a Runner interferes, Runners return to the last base touched at the time of the interference. Rule 9 Section 1f.</li>
      <li>The rule of thumb for deciding who is out on an interference is this:</li>
      <li>If the person who interfered can be called out (because they were a Batter, Batter-Runner or Runner who has not yet been put out – then they are out;</li>
      <li>If the person who interfered can’t be out (because they have already been called out or it was a coach, on-deck batter or other member of the offensive team) – then the runner closest to home is out.</li>

      </div>
      <li>When the Batter interferes with a play at the plate, he is out. Runners return to the last base held at the time of the Interference.</li>

      <li>The Runner is out when he intentionally interferes with a thrown ball. In this case an interference had occurred and the ball is dead.</li>

      </div>
      <li>The Runner closest to home is out if the coach leaves the coach’s box and makes the Fielder think he is a Runner by running toward home, and draws a throw from the Fielder to the catcher.</li>
